# **Containerized University Grading System**

## In this project, I developed a university grading system using flask. I have stored teacher and admin profiles in MongoDB and student profiles in Postgresql. When you enter 3 exams, the code automatically calculates the letter grade and average.

All you have to do is:
'''docker
docker-compose build 
''' 

Then:
'''docker
docker-compose up 
''' 

You can now send requests to the app with Postman.
